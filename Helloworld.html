			Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shinning and the air is warn, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an impressive pool, only three feet deep, but it's mine.<br/>
			There are three resons I like to swim:<br/>
			<ul type="disc">
				<li>I get lots of exercise</li>
				<li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
				<li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun.</li>
			</ul>
